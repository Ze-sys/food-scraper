# food-scraper
A simple vacation project done in summer of 2021 to
 - scrape food recipes from a website using scrapy
 - Build a NoSQL database using mongoDB
 - Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
 - Build a web app to visualize the data and model predictions using streamlit
 - Deployed app on streamlit share or other cloud services

# Tools and techniques mastered
- Selenium
- Scrapy, middlewares, pipelines, spiders
- MongoDB, mongosh, NoSQLBooster
- Database management, securing database following industry standards, querying, and data visualization
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Data wrangling
- EDA
- Deployment (didn't have time to do this for this particular project)
- THe DOM, inspecting the DOM, querying the DOM, and scraping the DOM

# Summary
I scrpaed 5000+ food recipes from a website using scrapy, built a database using mongoDB, built machine learning models using scikit-learn, built a web app to visualize the data and model predictions using streamlit. The main goal of this project was to document the tools and techniques that I thought myself and reference some of them in the future.
